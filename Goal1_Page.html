            <p class="header-text">Why does it matter?</p> 
            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In 2015, more than 700 million people, or 10 per cent of the world population, lived in extreme poverty, struggling to fulfil the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is reversing the trend of poverty reduction with tens of millions of people in risk of being pushed back into extreme poverty - people living on less than $1.90/day - causing the first increase in global poverty in more than 20 years. 
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Even before COVID-19, baseline projections suggested that 6 per cent of the global population would still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending poverty. 
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Developing countries will face a devastating social and economic crisis over the months and years to come, with the pandemic pushing millions of workers into unemployment, underemployment and working poverty. 
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Having a job also does not guarantee a decent living. In fact, 7.1 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2019, a positive decline compared to 2010, but the number is expected to rise in light of the long-term consequences of the pandemic.

            <p class="header-text">So what can I do about it?</p> 
            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Your active engagement in policymaking can make a difference in addressing poverty. It ensures that your rights are promoted and that your voice is heard, that intergenerational knowledge is shared, and that innovation and critical thinking are encouraged at all ages to support transformational change in peopleâ€™s lives and communities. 
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Governments can help create an enabling environment to generate productive employment and job opportunities for the poor and the marginalized. 
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The private sector has a major role to play in determining whether the growth it creates is inclusive and contributes to poverty reduction. It can promote economic opportunities for the poor. 
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The contribution of science to end poverty has been significant. For example, it has enabled access to safe drinking water, reduced deaths caused by water-borne diseases, and improved hygiene to reduce health risks related to unsafe drinking water and lack of sanitation.

                <li>1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day</li>
                <li>1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions</li>
                <li>1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable</li>
                <li>1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance</li>
                <li>1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters</li>
                <li>1.A Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions</li>
                <li>1.B Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions</li>
