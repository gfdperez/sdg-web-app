                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In light of the consequences of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that strengthening multilateralism and global partnerships are more important than ever if we are to solve the world’s problems. The Sustainable Developmet Goals remain the framework for building back better. We need everyone to come together—governments, civil society, scientists, academia and the private sector.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                We are all in this together. The Agenda, with its 17 goals, is universal and calls for action by all countries, both developed countries and developing countries, to ensure no one is left behind.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Support for implementing the SDGs has been steady but fragile, with major and persistent challenges. Financial resources remain scarce, trade tensions have been increasing, and crucial data are still lacking. The COVID-19 pandemic is now threatening past achievements, with trade, foreign direct investment and remittances all projected to declineby up to 40% in 2020.

                This will be primarily the responsibility of countries. Reviews of progress will need to be undertaken regularly in each country, involving civil society, business and representatives of various interest groups. At the regional level, countries will share experiences and tackle common issues, while on an annual basis, at the United Nations, the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), they will take stock of progress at the global level, identifying gaps and emerging issues, and recommending corrective action.
