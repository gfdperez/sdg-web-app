            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Over 90 per cent of COVID19 cases are occurring in urban areas, with the 1 billion residents of the world’s densely populated slums being hit the hardest. Even before the coronavirus, rapid urbanization meant that 4 billion people – over half of the global pupulation – in the world’s cities faced worsening air pollution, inadequate infrastructure and services, and unplanned urban sprawl. Successful examples of containing COVID-19 demonstrate the remarkable resilience and adaptability of urban communities in adjusting to new norms.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Cities occupy just 3 per cent of the Earth’s land, but account for 60-80 per cent of energy consumption and 75 per cent of carbon emissions. Many cities are also more vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters due to their high concentration of people and location so building urban resilience is crucial to avoid human, social and economic losses.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                All these issues will eventually affect every citizen. Inequality can lead to unrest and insecurity, pollution deteriorates everyone’s health and affects workers’ productivity and therefore the economy, and natural disasters have the potential to disrupt everyone’s lifestyles.

            <p class="header-text">So what can I do about it?</p>
            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Take an active interest in the governance and management of your city. Advocate for the kind of city you believe you need.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Develop a vision for your building, street, and neighbourhood, and act on that vision. Are there enough jobs? Can your children walk to school safely? Can you walk with your family at night? How far is the nearest public transport? What’s the air quality like? What are your shared public spaces like? The better the conditions you create in your community, the greater the effect on quality of life.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                There is a cost to creating a functional public transport network, but the benefits are huge in terms of economic activity, quality of life, the environment, and the overall success of a networked city.
