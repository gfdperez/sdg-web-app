                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Education helps reduce inequalities and reach gender equality and is crucial to fostering tolerance and more peaceful societies.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Over the past decade, major progress has been made towards increasing access to education and school enrollment rates at all levels, particularly for girls. Nevertheless, about 258 million children annd youth were still out of school in 2018 — nearly one fifth of the global population in that age group.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe, countries announced the temporary closure of schools, impacting more than 91 per cent of students worldwide. By April 2020, close to 1.6 billion children and youth were out of school.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Despite years of steady growth in enrolment rates, non-proficiency rates remain disturbingly high. In 2018, some 773 million adults—twothirds of whom are women—remained illiterate in terms of reading and writing skills. And the sheer magnitude of school closures due to COVID-19 is likely to set back progress on access to education.

            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Ask our governments to place education as a priority in both policy and practice. Lobby our governments to make firm commitments to provide free primary school education to all, including vulnerable or marginalized groups.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Teachers play an important role in childhood development and must have in their hands the right tools and resources to create an enabling environment in which students feel safe and free to be able to comment, talk about their feelings, and learn.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                We must develop trained teachers that can transform the future, one child at a time. We can obtain this by training our teachers in methods such as Montessori or open learning to promote an active learning pedagogy.
