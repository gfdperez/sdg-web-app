                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The climate crisis continues unabated as the global community shies away from the full commitment required for its reversal. 2010-2019 was warmest decade ever recorded, bringing with it massive wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, floods and other climate disasters across continents.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Climate change is affecting every country in the world. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives and livelihoods, especially for the most vulnerable. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, and weather events are becoming more extreme, affecting more than 39 million people in 2018.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                If left unchecked, climate change will cause average global temperatures to increase beyond 3°C, and will adversely affect every ecosystem. Already, we are seeing how climate change can exacerbate storms and disasters, and threats such as food and water scarcity, which can lead to conflict.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Here are some ways you can help with preventing the increase of climate change: Compost, composting food scraps can reduce climate impact while also recycling nutrients. Reduce your use of paper, avoid printing and substitute it with electronic devices or carriers. Recycle paper, glass, plastic, metal and old electronics. Buy eco-friendly products, Read the packaging to see if products are produced in an eco-friendly way. Choose reusable products, Use an eco-bag for shopping and a reusable water bottle or a cup to reduce your plastic waste.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Offset your carbon emissions. Bike, walk or take public transport. Save the car trips for when you’ve got a big group.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Consume less meat and become vegetarian for one day a week. The meat production industry has a huge impact on the environment.
