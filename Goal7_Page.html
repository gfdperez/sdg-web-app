            <p class="header-text">Why does it matter?</p>
            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                A well-established energy system supports all sectors: from businesses, medicine and education to agriculture, infrastructure, communications and high-technology.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                For many decades, fossil fuels such as coal, oil or gas have been major sources of electricity production, but burning carbon fuels produces large amounts of greenhouse gases which cause climate change and have harmful impacts on people’s well-being and the environment. This affects everyone, not just a few. Moreover, global electricity use is rising rapidly. In a nutshell, without a stable electricity supply, countries will not be able to power their economies.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Access to electricity in poorer countries has begun to accelerate, energy efficiency continues to improve, and renewable energy is making impressive gains. Nevertheless, more focused attention is needed to improve access to clean and safe cooking fuels and technologies for 2.8 billion people.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Nearly 9 out of 10 people now have access to electricity, but reaching the unserved 789 million around the world – 548 million people in subSaharan Africa alone – that lack access will require increased efforts.

            <p class="header-text">So what can I do about it?</p>
            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Countries can accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy system by investing in renewable energy resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting clean energy technologies and infrastructure.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Businesses can maintain and protect ecosystems and commit to sourcing 100% of operational electricity needs from renewable sources.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Employers can reduce the internal demand for transport by prioritizing telecommunications and incentivize less energy intensive modes such as train travel over auto and air travel. Investors can invest more in sustainable energy services, bringing new technologies to the market quickly from a diverse supplier base.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                You can save electricity by plugging appliances into a power strip and turning them off completely when not in use, including your computer. You can also bike, walk or take public transport to reduce carbon emissions.
