            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The demand for water has outpaced population growth, and half the world’s population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In 2017, an estimated 3 billion people worldwide lacked the ability to safely wash their hands at home – one of the cheapest, easiest and most effective ways to prevent the spread of diseases like the coronavirus.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Water, sanitation and hygiene services are also not always available at medical care facilities: in 2016, one in four facilities around the world lacked basic water supplies, one in five had no sanitation services, and two in five had no soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub, at points of care.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Water is essential not only to health, but also to poverty reduction, food security, peace and human rights, ecosystems and education. Nevertheless, countries face growing challenges linked to water scarcity, water pollution, degraded waterrelated ecosystems and cooperation over transboundary water basins.

        <div class="can-do-container">
            <p class="header-text">So what can I do about it?</p>
            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Civil society organizations should work to keep governments accountable, invest in water research and development, and promote the inclusion of women, youth and indigenous communities in water resources governance.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Generating awareness of these roles and turning them into action will lead to win-win results and increased sustainability and integrity for both human and ecological systems.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Ensuring that everyone has access to sustainable water and sanitation services is a critical climate change mitigation strategy for the years ahead.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                You can also get involved in the World Water Day and World Toilet Day campaigns that aim to provide information and inspiration to take action on hygiene issues.
