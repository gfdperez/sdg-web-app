            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being is important to building prosperous societies.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                However, the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated health systems globally and threatens already achieved health outcomes. Most countries, especially poor countries, have insufficient health facilities, medical supplies and health care workers for the surge in demand.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In 2017, only around one third to half of the global population was covered by essential health services. If current trends continue, only 39 per cent to 63 per cent of the global population will be covered by essential health services by 2030.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The pandemic has shown that in rich and poor countries alike, a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Concerted efforts are required to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health; address the growing burden of zoonotic and non-communicable diseases, tackle antimicrobial resistance and environmental factors contributing to ill health.

        <div class="can-do-container">
            <p class="header-text">So what can I do about it?</p>
            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                You can start by promoting and protecting your own health and the health of those around you, by making well-informed choices, practicing safe sex and vaccinating your children.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                You can raise awareness in your community about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as people’s right to quality health care services, especially for the most vulnerable such as women and children.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                You can also hold your government, local leaders and other decisionmakers accountable to their commitments to improve people’s access to health and health care.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Ensuring healthy lives for all requires a strong commitment, but the benefits outweigh the cost. Healthy people are the foundation for healthy economies.
