                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                People everywhere need to be free of fear from all forms of violence and feel safe as they go about their lives whatever their ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Conflict, insecurity, weak institutions and limited access to justice remain threats to sustainable development. In 2019, the number of people fleeing war, persecution and conflict exceeded 79.5 million, the highest level ever recorded. One in four children continues to be deprived of legal identity through lack of birth registration, often limiting their ability to exercise rights in other areas. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to amplify and exploit fragilities across the globe.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                 From 2015 to 2019, the United Nations recorded at least 1,940 killings and 106 enforced disappearances of human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists across 81 countries, with over half of killings occurring in Latin America and the Caribbean.
                 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Crimes that threaten the foundation of peaceful societies, including homicides, human trafficking and other organized crimes, as well as discriminatory laws or practices, affect all countries.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Exercise your right to hold your elected officials to account. Exercise your right to freedom of information and share your opinion with your elected representatives.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Promote inclusion and respect towards people of different ethnic origins, religions, gender, sexual orientations or different opinions. Together, we can help to improve conditions for a life of dignity for all.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Governments, civil society and communities must work together to implement lasting solutions to reduce violence, deliver justice, combat corruption and ensure inclusive participation at all times.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Laws and policies must be applied without any form of discrimination. Disputes need to be resolved through functioning and justice systems.
