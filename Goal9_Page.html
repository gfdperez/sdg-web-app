            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Economic growth, social development and climate action are heavily dependent on investments in infrastructure, sustainable industrial development and technological progress. In the face of a rapidly changing global economic landscape and increasing inequalities, sustained growth must include industrialization that first of all, makes opportunities accessible to all people, and second, is supported by innovation and resilient infrastructure
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Basic infrastructure like roads, information and communication technologies, sanitation, electrical power and water remains scarce in many developing countries. In 2019, some 87 per cent of people in developed countries used the Internet, compared with just 19 per cent in the least developed countries.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. They play a key role in introducing and promoting new technologies, facilitating international trade and enabling the efficient use of resources.

            <p class="header-text">So what can I do about it?</p>
            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Establish standards and promote regulations that ensure company projects and initiatives are sustainably managed.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Collaborate with NGOs and the public sector to help promote sustainable growth within developing countries.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Think about how industry impacts on your life and well-being and use social media to push for policymakers to prioritize the SDGs
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The growth of new industries means improvement in the standard of living for many of us. If industries pursue sustainability, this approach will have a positive effect on the environment.
