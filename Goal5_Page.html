            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Women and girls represent half of the worldâ€™s population and therefore also half of its potential. But, today gender inequality persists everywhere and stagnates social progress. Women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. Across the globe, women and girls perform a disproportionate share of unpaid domestic work.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Inequalities faced by girls can begin right at birth and follow them all their lives. In some countries, girls are deprived of access to health care or proper nutrition, leading to a higher mortality rate.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Worldwide, 35 per cent of women between 15-49 years of age have experienced physical and/ or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence. 1 in 3 girls aged 15-19 have experienced some form of female genital mutilation/cutting in the 30 countries in Africa and the Middle East, where the harmful practice is most common with a high risk of prolonged bleeding, infection (including HIV), childbirth complications, infertility and death.

            <p class="header-text">So what can I do about it?</p>
            <p class="description-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                If you are a girl, you can stay in school, help empower your female classmates to do the same and fight for your right to access sexual and reproductive health services. If you are a woman, you can address unconscious biases and implicit associations that form an unintended and often an invisible barrier to equal opportunity.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                If you are a man or a boy, you can work alongside women and girls to achieve gender equality and embrace healthy, respectful relationships.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                You can fund education campaigns to curb cultural practices like female genital mutilation and change harmful laws that limit the rights of women and girls and prevent them from achieving their full potential.
