                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development and very survival depend.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                COVID-19 offers an opportunity to develop recovery plans that will reverse current trends and shift our consumption and production patterns to a more sustainable course. A successful transition will mean improvements in resource efficiency, consideration of the entire life cycle of economic activities, and active engagement in multilateral environmental agreements.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The global material footprint – an indicator of the pressure put on the environment to support economic growth and to satisfy the material needs of people – grew by 17.4 per cent to 85.9 billion metric tons in 2017 as compared to 2010.

                As a business, it’s in businesses’ interest to find new solutions that enable sustainable consumption and production patterns. A better understanding of environmental and social impacts of products and services is needed, both of product life cycles and how these are affected by use within lifestyles.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Innovation and design solutions can both enable and inspire individuals to lead more sustainable lifestyles, reducing impacts and improving well-being.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                As a consumer, There are two main ways to help: 1. Reducing your waste and 2. Being thoughtful about what you buy and choosing a sustainable option whenever possible. Ensure you don’t throw away food, and reduce your consumption of plastic—one of the main pollutants of the ocean. Carrying a reusable bag, refusing to use plastic straws, and recycling plastic bottles are good ways to do your part every day.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Making informed purchases also helps. If you can buy from sustainable and local sources you can make a difference as well as exercising pressure on businesses to adopt sustainable practices.
